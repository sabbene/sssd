Subject: [PATCH 6/6] sbus: arm watchdog for sbus_connect_init_send()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

There seem to be conditions where the reply in the
sbus_call_DBus_Hello_send() request gets lost and the backend cannot
properly initialize its sbus/DBus server. Since the backend cannot be
connected by the frontends in this state the best way to recover would
be a restart. Since the event-loop is active in this state, e.g. waiting
for the reply, the watchdog will not consider the process as hung and
will not restart the process.

To make the watchdog handle this case arm_watchdog() and
disarm_watchdog() are called before and after the request, respectively.
